##History
One day in 2003, I was watching
[Strong Bad Email #4](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail4.html).  At the
end, Strong Bad plays a game that is supposed to be
[Temple of Apshai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Apshai) but is
apparently just a mock-up of a generic CGA-era dungeon crawler.  I saw this and
thought it would be cool to play a real game with that look and feel, so I
wrote a simple one in QBASIC.  Eight years later, I rediscovered my old
unfinished program and thought a more developed remake of it would be a fun
project for trying out Lua and the LÖVE framework.
