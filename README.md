#Temple of Anput
* featuring procedurally generated dungeon action and CGA graphics!
* written using the awesome [LÖVE](http://love2d.org) framework
* not finished yet; this is essentially an engine demo

##History
One day, when I was 16, I was watching
[Strong Bad Email #4](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail4.html).  At the
end, Strong Bad plays a game that is supposed to be
[Temple of Apshai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Apshai) but is
apparently just a mock-up of a generic CGA-era dungeon crawler.  I saw this and
thought it would be cool to play a real game with that look and feel, so I
wrote one in QBASIC.  Eight years later, I rediscovered my old unfinished
program and thought a remake of it would be a fun project for trying out Lua
and the LÖVE framework.
